Solve 4 pics 1 word riddles
===========================

1wf is a very simple script written in miranda
that soves '4 pics one word' (4p1w) riddles.
It basically just searches words that only contain letters
from the letter field within 4p1w and have the length of the
searched word. Of course, there are already solution databases
on the internet, but this approach is more generic and does not
need to be updated.

Requirements
------------

Of course you need miranda installed.
I know it is old and outdated and segfaults often
and is propietary, but whatever, here
you go.

Installation
------------

Type

	make install

and then let it solve your problems.

Quirks
------

Of course, 1wf only finds a set of possible answers,
sorted after word frequency. If you have got a hard
4p1w riddle, there is a possibility
that 1wf will not give the correct answer at all.
I am sorry for that.

Thanks a lot to that guy who wrote miranda. It
is a shame you have not released the source code
yet, but hey, there is always a chance left.

this breaks you computer, okay?
